* Basic configuration

** Keep the starting screen clean

Once you've gone through the tutorial, there's no need to keep that stuff around.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t
      inhibit-startup-message t
      inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)
#+END_SRC

** Keep the GUI minimalistic

As I want my editor to get as much screen estate as possible, and prefer keyboard-driven
workflows, remove every visible bar, keeping only the mode-line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC
